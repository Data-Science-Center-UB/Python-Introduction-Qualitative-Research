    "\n",
    "In Python, a class defines a custom type: it bundles related data (**state**) and operations (**methods**) into reusable objects with a clear interface. A function (Notebook 5) is just an action that transforms inputs to outputs and doesn’t remember anything between calls. For most day-to-day research tasks like data cleaning, analysis pipelines, and plotting you can stay with functions and simple data structures. Use classes when your code needs memory (keep values between calls) or when you want to package data + actions together into something reusable.  In practice, existing libraries do a lot of what you get by classes for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two small pieces of class-specific syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__` is the setup step. It runs once when you create a new object. Use it to create and initialize the state of the object (its saved data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self` refers to \"this object\". Inside the class, self lets you read/change the data that belongs to this object. Python fills self in for you when you call a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a tiny example for when classes can help. It's a class that remembers counts across multiple texts and gives you simple methods to use that memory."

    "You don’t always need to build your own tools. **Libraries** are reusable code created by others—sometimes a single **module** (one `.py` file), sometimes a **package** (a collection of modules). Using them saves time and effort, and you benefit from tools that are already well-designed and tested. Using libraries is considered best practice in modern Python development. Most Python workflows rely on well-known general-purpose libraries like `pandas` or `numpy`. In addition to these, there are also specialized libraries tailored to specific needs, like `matplotlib` for advanced data visualization.\n",

    "- PyPI ([pypi.org](https://pypi.org)): main index of Python packages. Search matches names/summaries; use classifiers to browse by topic.\n",
    "- Anaconda / conda-forge: if you use Conda, search [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org) or [conda-forge.org](https://conda-forge.org).\n",
    "- GitHub ([github.com](https://github.com)): many projects host and develop code (and often docs) here. Example: [whisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX).\n",
    "- Curated lists/directories: e.g., [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) or [awesomepython.org](https://awesomepython.org). Persons are also curating domain-specific lists such as for hydrology ([Python-Hydrology-Tools](https://github.com/raoulcollenteur/Python-Hydrology-Tools)).\n",

Most projects provide a \"Getting Started\" or \"Quickstart\" section with a small example that shows what the library does and how to call its main functions. For instance, see the websites of the popular machine-learning library [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/getting_started.html), or [`spaCy`](https://spacy.io/usage) for Natural Language Processing."
